Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering

Q: What is your take-away message from this paper?

A: 

Q: What is the motivation for this work (both people problem and technical 
problem), and its distillation into a research question? Why doesn’t the people 
problem have a trivial solution? What are the previous solutions and why are 
they inadequate?

Foundations of Software Engineering

A: 

Q: What is the author’s evaluation of the solution? What logic, argument, 
evidence, artifacts (e.g., a proof-of-concept system), or experiments are 
presented in support of the idea?

A: 

Q: What is your analysis of the identified problem, idea and evaluation? Is this 
a good idea? What flaws do you perceive in the work? What are the most 
interesting or controversial ideas? For work that has practical implications, 
ask whether this will work, who would want it, what it will take to give it to 
them, and when might it become a reality?

A: 

Q: What are the paper’s contributions (author’s and your opinion)? Ideas, 
methods, software, experimental results, experimental techniques...?

A: 

Q: What are future directions for this research (author’s and yours, perhaps 
driven by shortcomings or other critiques)?

A: 

Q: What questions are you left with? What questions would you like to raise in 
an open discussion of the work (review interesting and controversial points, 
above)? What do you find difficult to understand? List as many as you can, at
least three, not including questions that can be answered quickly by searching 
the internet.
