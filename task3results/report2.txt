I was unsure whether we should manually specify the assertion lines, 
test functions, and file names and run the code 10 seperate times. I chose to
do so but it would be simple to automate everything by removing the checks
for file name, function name, and line numbers, since my functions already
traverse all of the code in all of the files of the given directory.
